# roku
A minimal, open source, Roku client for PC made with Python.

# Windows
Executable packages available on the [Releases](https://github.com/mcgregol/ropy/releases) page.

Note: I have to add a Roku device selector so the binary probably won't work and you'll have to compile yourself or run with Python after changing the device IP address. (Fixed in latest version.)

- `git clone https://github.com/mcgregol/ropy`
- `cd ropy`
- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- `python3 client.py`

# Linux
Executable package available on the [Releases](https://github.com/mcgregol/ropy/releases) page.

Make sure that `tk` is installed on your system.

- `git clone https://github.com/mcgregol/ropy`
- `cd ropy`
- `sudo pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
- `sudo python3 client.py`
